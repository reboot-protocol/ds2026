1 the witch walked into the woods and the wind whispered again
2 the night was dark and the witch waited again and again
3 the stone glowed in the dark woods where the witch stood
4 again the wind whispered the same old words to the witch
5 the witch feared the night and feared the wind again
6 in the woods the witch found a small glowing stone
7 the night grew darker and the wind grew louder again
8 again the witch whispered the words she feared to speak
9 the wind carried the words across the deep dark woods
10 the witch stepped forward and touched the glowing stone again
11 the night answered with silence and the wind faded
12 again the witch waited and the woods stood still
13 the stone pulsed softly and again the witch listened
14 the wind whispered and whispered the same strange sound
15 the night wrapped the woods in its dark arms again
16 the witch stood still and again the wind circled her
17 the stone glowed brighter and again the witch stepped back
18 in the woods the night grew heavier than before
19 again the whisper of the wind echoed between the trees
20 the witch felt the night watching her from afar
21 the stone shivered in her hand and again it glowed
22 the woods whispered old secrets and the witch listened again
23 again the night thickened and the wind howled low
24 the witch whispered the words the wind demanded again
25 the stone resisted and again the witch tightened her grip
26 the night whispered warnings through the dark cold woods
27 again the witch felt the strange pull of the stone
28 the wind circled the witch again and again
29 the woods bent under the weight of the dark night
30 the witch raised the stone and again it shimmered
31 the night cracked open with a whisper and the wind rose
32 again the witch spoke the ancient words aloud
33 the woods trembled as the wind grew stronger
34 again the stone pulsed and the night listened
35 the witch steadied herself and again faced the dark
36 the wind coiled around the witch and whispered again
37 the night wrapped the trees in deeper darkness
38 again the witch felt the stone beating in her palm
39 the woods shook as the wind tore through the branches
40 the night followed the witch deeper into the woods
41 again the stone glowed and the witch stepped forward
42 the wind whispered promises the witch could not trust
43 the night waited for the witch to speak again
44 the woods watched silently as the stone flickered
45 again the witch lifted the stone toward the wind
46 the night growled low and again the wind answered
47 the woods shifted quietly beneath the witch’s feet
48 again the stone hummed and the witch gasped
49 the wind pushed hard and again the witch stumbled
50 the night pulled the witch deeper into the dark
51 again the woods creaked under the weight of the wind
52 the stone brightened and again the witch steadied herself
53 the wind screamed across the woods and the night echoed
54 again the witch pressed the stone to her chest
55 the woods darkened as the wind circled again
56 the night leaned close to hear the witch speak
57 again the stone sparked and the witch cried out
58 the wind snapped branches and again the witch trembled
59 the woods trapped the sound of the night within them
60 again the witch whispered the ancient words in fear
61 the stone answered with a deep glow and again pulsed
62 the wind roared and the woods shook in reply
63 again the night pressed down on the witch
64 the stone became heavier and again it glowed
65 the wind twisted the trees and again they groaned
66 the witch staggered as the night tightened around her
67 again the stone shone with fierce bright light
68 the woods bowed as the wind screamed again
69 the night cracked with cold and the witch shouted
70 again the stone blazed and the woods blazed with it
71 the wind pulled at the witch’s cloak again
72 the night wrapped the glowing stone in shadow
73 again the woods whispered their oldest warnings
74 the stone throbbed in rhythm with the night
75 again the witch whispered to calm the stone
76 the wind leaned close to hear her words again
77 the night grew restless and the woods trembled
78 again the stone flashed and the witch shielded her eyes
79 the wind howled louder than ever and again shook the woods
80 the night burned cold and again the witch stepped back
81 the woods echoed the sound of the wind again
82 the stone cracked with light and again pulsed
83 the witch steadied her breath as the night closed in
84 the wind cut through the woods and again the trees groaned
85 the night pressed forward and the stone resisted
86 again the witch whispered the same ancient words
87 the wind spun wildly and again snapped branches
88 the woods shook under the weight of the stone’s light
89 the night trembled and again the witch shouted
90 the stone roared and the wind roared in answer
91 again the woods listened as the night leaned closer
92 the witch held the stone high and again it glowed
93 the wind swirled harder and again caught the witch’s cloak
94 the night pushed against the woods and again darkened
95 again the stone beat like a heart in the witch’s hand
96 the wind thundered and again shook the woods
97 the night swallowed the last of the light again
98 the witch dropped to her knees as the stone blazed
99 the wind whispered once more and again the night echoed
100 again the witch and the night and the wind stood still
